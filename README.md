[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/hrjn/ISLR_reading_group)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that reproduce several results from the [ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) book. The notebooks are directly rendered when viewed in GitHub. If you want to play with them, you can click on the Binder button up there, it will launch a containerized Jupyter session in your browser.
